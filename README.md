# SubSentry

**SubSentry is a dashboard for tracking user subscriptions (e.g., streaming, SaaS, utilities). It helps users visualize and manage recurring expenses in one place.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Subscription Overview**: Display all active subscriptions and their monthly costs.  
- **Category-wise Breakdown**: Group subscriptions by category (Entertainment, Productivity, etc.).  
- **Spending Insights**: Visual charts showing how much you spend per month or per category.  
- **Add / Delete Subscriptions**: Ability to add new services, set price, renewal date; remove expired ones.  
- **Notifications / Reminders (Prototype)**: UX flow for sending reminders before renewal.

## 🎯 Why This Project

Many people lose track of their recurring subscriptions — some cancel, some forget, and some get surprised by auto-renewals. This app is built to give a **transparent understanding** of monthly recurring costs, helping users make more informed decisions, avoid unnecessary spending, and stay on top of renewal dates.

## 🧪 Prototype & Design

This project is currently a **design prototype**. It’s not live for production use, but the site serves as a clickable demo for flows, UI, and interactions.

- **View Prototype**: [Figma Site / Demo Link]  
- **Design Tools**: Figma (Frames, Components, Prototyping)

---

## 🛠️ How to Use (for Viewers / Stakeholders)

1. **Open the Figma Site** – click through the frames to see the app flow.  
2. **Interact with UI Components** – use the buttons, dropdowns, and chart mockups to simulate usage.  
3. **Feedback** – since it’s a prototype, you can provide feedback on design, flows, or features.

## 📂 Project Structure (if this was a code repo)

Here’s how you might structure the project if you were to convert the Figma design into a working app:

/src
├── components/ # React / Vue components (UI)
├── pages/ # Different views — Dashboard, Add Subscription, Settings
├── services/ # API or local storage handling
├── utils/ # Helper functions (date utils, formatters)
├── assets/ # Icons, images
└── styles/ # CSS or styled-components


---

## 📈 Future Roadmap

- Build a **real web app** (React / Vue) using this design.  
- Integrate **authentication** (signup/login).  
- Use a **backend** + database to store user subscription data.  
- Add **push/email reminders** for renewal.  
- Provide **analytics dashboards** (yearly spend, cancel suggestions).

---

## 👥 Contributing

- Currently, this is a **design-only** project, so contributions could be in:  
  - Improving UI / UX flows  
  - Prototyping missing screens  
  - Translating design to a working web app (frontend + backend)  
- If you want to contribute, reach out / create a branch (if this is in a repo).
